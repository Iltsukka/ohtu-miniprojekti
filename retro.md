# Retroperspektiivi Sprint 2
[Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel](https://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Start,_Stop,_Continue,_More_of,_Less_of_Wheel)

### Process
1. Draw a circle on a poster, divide it into 5 sections and write the words "start", "stop", "continue", "more of" and "less of" around each section.
1. Ask: What should we start doing that perhaps we haven't done yet? What should we stop doing, that's not contributing or is getting in our way? What is working that we want to continue to do? What should we do more of? Less of?"
1. Encourage comments in any category. Clarify what category the comment belongs in, and record the comment (or summary of it) on the poster. Use silence - wait for comments.

The Retroperspective wheel was done in full body size and then documented here.
<pre>
START
    more in-depth sprint planning
    realtime burndown updates
    feature testings

STOP
    leaving CI failing commits on main

CONTINUE
    pre-demo meet ups

MORE OF
    discord updates
    backlog grooming
    tests

LESS OF
    big commits
</pre>

### Improvement planning
In the up comming sprint the team will improve communication in multiple forms. We will drive to be more active in Discord channel communication and update burndown chart and sprint backlog in realtime, to avoid conflicting work loads on tasks.

The team will also focus on reducings big commits and improve test coverage and quality. This will be monitored in GitHub CI workflows and failing commits will be fixed as soon as possible.

Before starting the next sprint, we will do more in-depth planning regarding tasks and used technologies.

The Retroperspective wheel was done in full body size and then documented here.
<pre>
START
    pair programming
STOP
    using pylint ignore
    
CONTINUE
    backlog constant updating

MORE OF
    unit-tests
    
LESS OF
    getting stuck with configuration
    procrastination
    bugs
</pre>

### Last retro successes
In our previous and first  Retroperspective we established and documented the areas that need improvement. We succeeded by starting doing feature tests, we continued our pre-demo meetups, and our backlog grooming got groomed more. 

The team will continue maintaining and implementing more of the documented Retoreperspectives from our previous Retroperspective meeting.

### Improvement planning
In our upcoming last sprint, the team will focus more on being productive by reducing time spent on configurations and procrastination in general. 

Testing and code quality will be prioritized by creating more unit tests. Code analysis tools like pylint will be utilized better, and pre-emptily noticeable bugs will be avoided. 

During and before our next sprint we will continuously keep the backlog updated and start pair programming to ensure our product/software will meet our and the customers' standards.
