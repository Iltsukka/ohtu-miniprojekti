# Retroperspektiivi Sprint 2
[Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel](https://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Start,_Stop,_Continue,_More_of,_Less_of_Wheel)

### Process
1. Draw a circle on a poster, divide it into 5 sections and write the words "start", "stop", "continue", "more of" and "less of" around each section.
1. Ask: What should we start doing that perhaps we haven't done yet? What should we stop doing, that's not contributing or is getting in our way? What is working that we want to continue to do? What should we do more of? Less of?"
1. Encourage comments in any category. Clarify what category the comment belongs in, and record the comment (or summary of it) on the poster. Use silence - wait for comments.

The Retroperspective wheel was done in full body size and then documented here.

### Improvement planning
In the up comming sprint the team will improve communication in multiple forms. We will drive to be more active in Discord channel communication and update burndown chart and sprint backlog in realtime, to avoid conflicting work loads on tasks.

The team will also focus on reducings big commits and improve test coverage and quality. This will be monitored in GitHub CI workflows and failing commits will be fixed as soon as possible.

Before starting the next sprint, we will do more in-depth planning regarding tasks and used technologies.
